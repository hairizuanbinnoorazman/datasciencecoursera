Feature Selection 
=================

The following features were selected based on requirements (based on the assignment given).
The required features for this assignment are measures which calculates the mean or standard
deviation of a measurement.

There are 6 activities carried out by each subject and there are 30 subjects
Due to that, there are 180 rows of data for this dataset.

The following list is the full list of variables included within the dataset.
A brief description of the variable is provided when necessary

"Subject" - Refers to the subject/tester in question. There are 30 testers.
"Activity" - 6 Activities are carried. Contrary to the original dataset, the data within this field/measurement
are in the text format and potrays the actual information of what the subject is doing. Original dataset only
contains numbers which require referencing to another text file.

The rest are data that is obtained from the original dataset itself.
The dataset is "rolled up" to depict the mean/average of each measurement for each subject for each of their activities
